That’s <span id="quote1">my last Duchess</span> painted on the wall,<br> 
Looking as if she were alive. I call<br> 
That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf’s hands<br> 
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.<br> 
<span id="quote2">Will’t please you sit and look at her?</span> I said<br> 
‘Frà Pandolf’ by design, for never read<br> 
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,<br> 
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,<br> 
But to myself they turned (<span id="quote3">since none puts by<br> 
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I</span>)<br> 
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,<br> 
How such a glance came there; so, not the first<br> 
Are you to turn and ask thus. <span id="quote4">Sir</span>, ’twas not<br> 
Her husband’s presence only, called that spot<br> 
Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek: perhaps<br> 
<span id="quote5">Frà Pandolf chanced to say</span> ‘Her mantle laps<br> 
Over my lady’s wrist too much,’ or ‘Paint<br> 
Must never hope to reproduce the faint<br> 
Half-flush that dies along her throat’: such stuff<br> 
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough<br> 
For calling up that <span id="quote6">spot of joy</span>. She had<br> 
A heart – how shall I say? – too soon made glad,<br> 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er<br> 
She looked on, and <span id="quote7">her looks went everywhere</span>.<br> 
Sir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,<br> 
The dropping of the daylight in the West,<br> 
The bough of cherries some officious fool<br> 
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule<br> 
She rode with round the terrace – all and each<br> 
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,<br> 
Or blush, at least. She thanked men, – good! but thanked<br> 
Somehow – I know not how – as if she ranked<br> 
<span id="quote8">My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name</span><br> 
With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame<br> 
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill<br> 
In speech – (<span id="quote9">which I have not</span>) – to make your will<br> 
Quite clear to such an one, and say, ‘Just this<br> 
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,<br> 
Or there exceed the mark’ – and if she let<br> 
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set<br> 
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,<br> 
– E’en then would be some stooping; and <span id="quote10">I choose<br> 
Never to stoop</span>. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,<br> 
Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without<br> 
Much the same smile? This grew; <span id="quote11">I gave commands;<br> 
Then all smiles stopped together</span>. There she stands<br> 
<span id="quote12">As if alive</span>. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet<br> 
The company below, then. I repeat,<br> 
The Count your master’s known munificence<br> 
Is ample warrant that no just pretence<br> 
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;<br> 
Though <span id="quote13">his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed<br> 
At starting, is my object</span>. Nay, we’ll go<br> 
Together down, sir. <span id="quote14">Notice Neptune, though,<br> 
Taming a sea-horse</span>, thought a rarity,<br> 
Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!

          <div id="commentary">
             <p id="quote1c">The use of ‘my’ highlights the Duke’s self-importance
             and possessive nature- he is implying that the duchess belongs to 
             him. This was common in the Victorian era (when the poem was written),
             where married women were considered the legal property of their 
             husbands.</p>
             <p id="quote2c">Although this is posed as a question, the Duke is 
             really demanding that the listener should sit down in order to listen
             to him speak. This reflects his need to control, as he asks a similar
             question again, later in the poem (“Will’t please you rise?”), and 
             so emphasises the idea that the Duke feels he is superior to the 
             listener. He remains standing throughout, forcing the listener to 
             look up at him, which provides a visual hint that he is the ‘master’.</p>
             <p id="quote3c">This phrase is a metaphor to show the Duke’s need to
             control the duchess- he is frustrated by her paying attention to 
             others and smiling at them, so he hides her away behind a curtain so
             that she can only smile for him when he wants her to.</p>
             <p id="quote4c">Throughout the poem, the Duke addresses the listener
             with formal language. Initially, this is to suggest he is polite, 
             but instead it shows how the Duke feels superior to the listener, 
             and wants them to realise the same thing. ‘Thee’ etc. would be far 
             more colloquial, and suggest the two are equals, but instead, the 
             Duke is being condescending and emphasising his superiority.</p>
             <p id="quote5c">The Duke repeats the name several times throughout
             the poem, showing his vanity. In addition, ‘Frà’ means ‘brother’, 
             so Frà Pandolf is likely to be a monk. However, the Duke is accusing
             him of flirting with the duchess (“Her mantle laps Over my lady’s 
             wrist too much,”), but as a religious figure, this is unlikely to 
             be something that happened. Consequently, it indicates that the Duke
             is paranoid and unjust.</p>
             <p id="quote6c">This is repeated in the poem, suggesting that the 
             fact that the duchess is smiling makes him very angry. This shows 
             that he is being irrational- the Duke in the poem is based on Duke 
             Alfonso II d’Este, whose first wife was only 14 when they married, 
             and who died aged 17 under suspicious circumstances. Therefore, it 
             is likely that the traits she had that enraged the Duke, such as 
             humility and gratitude, are because she was young and innocent. 
             Browning is using satire here, as during the Victorian era, it was
             widely believed that women were incapable of rational thought, yet 
             here, the Duke is the irrational character.</p>
             <p id="quote7c">This phrase is very dismissive, suggesting that the
             Duke is jealous of everything that receives attention from his wife.
             He views her as his possession, and so he doesn’t want to ‘share’ 
             her. Once again, it also shows his paranoia- the phrase is hyperbolic,
             showing he is mistaking her curiosity for flirting.</p>
             <p id="quote8c">This indicates that the Duke is obsessed with status-
             the family of his first wife could be described as ‘nouveau-riche’,
             and so he feels that his higher social class is something his wife 
             should be very grateful for, even though she would be unlikely to view
             it as important. His anger at her disregard for this is shown by 
             how he embellishes ‘name’ with adjectives, in an attempt to emphasise
             the importance it has to him.</p>
             <p id="quote9c">This interjection indicates that the Duke is 
             untrustworthy- he is implying that he is not a good speaker, yet his
             speech is a perfectly structured argument, entirely in iambic 
             pentameter. This shows that the Duke is not who he attempts to 
             portray himself as- his polite tone is condescending, his demands are
             disguised as questions etc.</p>
             <p id="quote10c">This shows the full extent of the Duke’s obsession
             with status, in that he is more comfortable in ordering his wife’s 
             murder than to momentarily make himself his wife’s equal and actually
             speak to her.</p>
             <p id="quote11c">These lines have an ambiguous meaning- the Duke uses
             a euphemism to show that he ordered his wife’s murder, yet he hides
             this from the listener from not admitting outright. This indicates 
             his arrogance- he is admitting to murder, but in a way that makes it
             clear to the listener that they are inferior and cannot accuse him,
             because he has not explicitly said that his wife’s death was his fault.</p>
             <p id="quote12c">This has an ambiguous purpose- the duke could be 
             indicating that the painting is very realistic, and also that his 
             wife is dead. However, the repetition indicates that he actually 
             prefers his wife as a painting than as a living person, which ties 
             into his need for control.</p>
             <p id="quote13c">This suggests that the Duke is not in control of his
             own speech, as he mentions the dowry he will receive from a second 
             marriage, then seems to backtrack by assuring the listener that his
             real ‘prize’ will be the companionship of a wife rather than the money.
             However, this actually gives the opposite impression, thus showing
             that the Duke is not entirely able to control his personality. This
             links to the Victorian ideas of duality; the Duke attempts to make
             himself look like a respectable nobleman, but the reader is also 
             shown another, darker side to him. This would be shocking to audiences
             at the time this poem was published.</p>
             <p id="quote14c">This ends the poem with a metaphor for the Duke- 
             he views himself as the all-powerful Neptune, exercising his power
             over the Duchess. He feels he is in his domain, and his job is to 
             control women, as was common during the Victorian era, where married
             women were the ‘possessions’ of their husbands. The poet is suggesting
             that the Duke feels the need to surround himself with art as symbols
             of power- he points them out to the listener as decorations, but they
             are much more to do with ego than an interest in art.</p>
