<tr><td id="filler1"></td><td id="content"><p>One summer evening (<span id="quote1">led by her</span>) I found<br>
 A little boat tied to a willow tree<br>
 Within a rocky cove, its usual home.<br>
 Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in<br>
 Pushed from the shore. It was an <span id="quote2">act of stealth</span><br>
 And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice<br>
 Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;<br>
 Leaving behind her still, on either side,<br>
 <span id="quote3">Small circles glittering idly in the moon,<br>
 Until they melted all into one track<br>
 Of sparkling light</span>. But now, like one who rows,<br>
 Proud of his skill, to reach a <span id="quote4">chosen point</span><br>
 With an unswerving line, I fixed my view<br>
 Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,<br>
 The horizon’s utmost boundary; <span id="quote5">far above<br>
 Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky</span>.<br>
 She was an <span id="quote6">elfin pinnace</span>; lustily<br>
 I dipped my oars into the silent lake,<br>
 And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat<br>
 Went heaving through the water like a swan;<br>
 When, from behind that craggy steep till then<br>
 The horizon’s bound, a <span id="quote7">huge peak, black and huge</span>,<br>
 As if with voluntary power instinct,<br>
 <span id="quote8">Upreared its head</span>. <span id="quote9">I struck and struck again</span>,<br>
 And growing still in stature the grim shape<br>
 Towered up between me and the stars, and still,<br>
 For so it seemed, with purpose of its own<br>
 And measured motion like a living thing,<br>
 <span id="quote10">Strode after me</span>. With trembling oars I turned,<br>
 And through the silent water <span id="quote11">stole my way</span><br>
 Back to the covert of the willow tree;<br>
 There in her mooring-place I left my bark, –<br>
 And through the meadows homeward went, in grave<br>
 And serious mood; but after I had seen<br>
 That spectacle, for many days, my brain<br>
 Worked with a <span id="quote12">dim and undetermined sense<br>
 Of unknown modes of being</span>; o’er my thoughts<br>
 There hung a darkness, <span id="quote13">call it solitude</span><br>
 Or blank desertion. <span id="quote14">No familiar shapes<br>
 Remained, no pleasant images of trees,<br>
 Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields</span>;<br>
 But huge and mighty forms, that do not live<br>
 Like living men, moved slowly through the mind<br>
 By day, and were a trouble to my dreams<br>

          <div id="commentary">
             <p id="quote1c">‘Her’ has an ambiguous meaning- it could be 
             referring to a girl, Nature, or even Wordsworth’s mother (who died
             before when the extract is set, possibly using her as a reference 
             to fate). However, as the poem goes on, Wordsworth implies that he
             is referring to Nature, who leads him out intentionally to show him
             that people like him are not in control, that they are inferior to
             the power of nature. “Led by” backs this up; it suggests that in the
             poem, the poet has no initial intention to steal the boat, but some
             unknown force makes him do it.</p>
            <p id="quote2c">“Stealth” has connotations of something being sneaky
            /sly, showing that the poet is aware that what he is doing is morally
            wrong. However, the use of the oxymoron “troubled pleasure” indicates
            his apathy to the theft, showing that he is selfish and proud. This
            sense of human pride was important to Wordsworth- he wanted to show
            that those who feel they are dominant over nature are wrong. The 
            repeated allusions to pride (“Proud of his skill”) create a sharp 
            juxtaposition with the change in tone later in the poem, emphasising 
            that man is in fact far inferior to the power of nature.</p>
            <p id="quote3c">These lines create a positive semantic field, giving
            a ‘magical’ air to the poet’s actions. This fantastical language 
            fits with the form of the poem (‘The Prelude’ is an ‘epic poem’, 
            which often have legendary elements), suggesting a shift in who the
            ‘hero’ is in the poem. In the overall work (“The Recluse”), 
            Wordsworth is obviously the hero, but in this extract, the hero seems
            to shift from the poet to nature itself, as when the tone of the poem
            changes to fear, the use of positive imagery stops.</p>
            <p id="quote4c">At this point in the poem, the poet feels in control-
            they have ‘chosen’ a point, exerting their own power. This shows the
            poet feels proud and powerful. However, when the other part of the 
            mountain comes into view behind this point, it creates a sense of fear,
            as the poet suddenly realises he does not know everything. This is
            unnerving, and shows that he is just realising that nature has more
            power than him.</p>
            <p id="quote5c">‘Nothing but the stars’ gives a sense of solitude,
            which makes the appearance of the new peak more threatening, as the
            poet has already assumed he is alone. When he sees the new peak, the
            poet becomes afraid, as they suddenly realise that something they 
            believed was true (i.e. that there was nothing beyond the ‘craggy 
            ridge’) is in fact incorrect.</p>
            <p id="quote6c">elfin pinnace- Here, Wordsworth is showing his pride
            by exaggerating the ‘little boat’ into an ‘elfin pinnace’, with the
            adjective ‘elfin’ giving it a mythical quality (as is common in epic
            poetry).</p>
            <p id="quote7c">The repetition of ‘huge’ shows how the shock and fear
            is causing the poet’s vocabulary to regress, from the use of similes
            such as ‘like a swan’ to the basic ‘huge’. This may be because 
            Wordsworth would be writing the poem several years after the actual 
            event, and so the memory scares him enough to switch from his 
            elaborate ‘adult’ vocabulary to the one he would have had as a boy.
            This indicates how his fear is causing his pride to leave him.</p>
            <p id="quote8c">The entire sentence, from “When from behind that 
            craggy steep” to “Upreared its head” is very long, with several 
            different phrases that create imagery, but are superficial. The 
            sentence could be simplified to “When a huge peak upreared its head”,
            but the excess information creates a sense of being overwhelmed, as 
            it draws out the moment, heightening the tension.</p>
            <p id="quote9c">The repetition of ‘struck’ creates a sense of 
            desperation, as it has a plosive ‘k’ sound, and the repeated ‘s’ 
            creates sibilance, which mimics splashing. This is very different 
            to the relaxed focus on simple beauty (“small circles glittering 
            idly”) earlier on in the poem, creating juxtaposition between the two
             tones. This shows how the revelation is influencing the poet.</p>
            <p id="quote10c">The mountain is personified with a verb that has 
            connotations of purpose and dominance, showing that Wordsworth feels
            inferior to the power of nature. It also indicates that he is losing
            his grip on reality; he can’t be sure if everything he knows is true
            or not. In fact, he acknowledges this as an adult by saying “for so 
            it seemed”- he is rational enough to know he is not really being 
            chased, but he still feels threatened.</p>
            <p id="quote11c">“Stole” has similar connotations to ‘stealth’ 
            earlier in the poem (sly etc.), but this time it has a different tone-
            initially, Wordsworth is confident in his theft, brazenly removing 
            the locks (“straight I unloosed her chain”), but now he is careful,
            hiding from this unknown power that has scared him.</p>
            <p id="quote12c">The use of the adjectives ‘dim’ and ‘undetermined’ 
            are vague, as if the poet is can’t understand what he has experienced,
            and why it has affected him in that way. This conveys his shock, and
            how he no longer feels ‘in control’.</p>
            <p id="quote13c">Here, Wordsworth is implying that he is struggling
            to put a name to his feelings. This attitude is very different to the
            confident use of specific language at the beginning of the poem. He 
            seems to almost be giving the reader a choice to interpret it in the
            way they wish, which is a submissive act when recounting a first-hand
            experience, as if he no longer feels ‘worthy’.</p>
            <p id="quote14c">The repetition of ‘no’ suggests that the poet is so
            affected by the realisation that he does not know everything, he 
            stops being able to describe the event and his feelings by what he 
            knows, but rather what he doesn’t know. This indicates how insecure
            the understanding that nature is far greater than him has made him.</p>
