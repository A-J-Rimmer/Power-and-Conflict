Sink walls in rock and roof them with good slate.<br> 
<span id="quote2">This wizened earth</span> has never troubled us<br> 
With hay, so, as you see, there are no stacks<br> 
Or stooks that can be lost. Nor are there trees<br> 
Which might prove company when it blows full<br> 
Blast: <span id="quote3">you know what I mean</span> – leaves and branches<br> 
Can raise a tragic chorus in a gale<br> 
<span id="quote4">So that you can listen to the thing you fear</span><br> 
Forgetting that it pummels your house too.<br> 
But there are no trees, no natural shelter.<br> 
You might think that the sea is company,<br> 
<span id="quote5">Exploding comfortably</span> down on the cliffs<br> 
But no: when it begins, the flung spray hits<br> 
The very windows, <span id="quote6">spits like a tame cat</span><br> 
Turned savage. We just sit tight while wind dives<br> 
And strafes invisibly. <span id="quote7">Space is a salvo</span>,<br> 
We are bombarded by the empty air.<br> 
Strange, <span id="quote8">it is a huge nothing that we fear</span>.

          <div id="commentary">
             <p id="quote1c">The use of the pronoun ‘we’ implies that the storm 
             is experienced by a large community, showing how the storm (and 
             therefore the civil war) affects the entire population. It also 
             creates an air of solidarity- the reader assumes that if there is a
             ‘we’, there must be a ‘them’ (i.e. an opponent). <br><br>
This line also suggests confidence- the use of a strong simple sentence gives the
impression that the islanders are not afraid of the coming storm. However, later
in the poem, this tone changes, implying that the storm (and the war it represents)
is far more terrifying and violent than expected.</p>
             <p id="quote2c">This personifies the earth, and suggests familiarity,
             once again indicating how the voice of the poem feels at home in the
             harsh conditions. They seem to be addressing the earth like an old 
             friend, rather than something they feel must be conquered.</p>
             <p id="quote3c">This aside creates a conversational tone, which 
             contrasts against the rest of the poem, where the predominant theme
             is one of hardship and fear. Consequently, this makes the violent 
             language used seem much more ‘normal’, as Heaney is implying that 
             the danger is commonplace for the speaker- it’s merely a part of life.
             This could be seen as a criticism of the Troubles- at the time of 
             publishing, there had been conflict in Ireland for over 30 years. 
             As a result, people could have started to become desensitised to the
             violence. In the poem, the tone changes from confidence to fear, 
             suggesting that even if the public are expecting violence, there 
             will still be events that get progressively more awful that will shock them.</p>
             <p id="quote4c">The poem is in iambic pentameter, yet this line has
             an extra syllable, ending on ‘fear’. This breaks the rhythm of the 
             poem, and so emphasises the word ‘fear’, helping the audience to 
             understand the emotions of the islanders. <br><br>
Additionally, the break in iambic pentameter also suggests that people are afraid
because they lack control- the carefully structured rhythm is breaking up, just 
like their preparation for the storm. This is unsettling, and implies that despite
their best efforts, humans will never be able to control nature.</p>
             <p id="quote5c">This oxymoron also suggests that the violence is now
             an expected way of life. However, it can be interpreted in another 
             way- the sea is attacking “down on the cliffs”, which distances it 
             from the voice of the poem. This implies that people are less worried
             about violence when it’s not occurring near them. As a result, it can
             be read as a criticism of those living in other areas, suggesting 
             they were being ignorant to the needs of others.</p>
             <p id="quote6c">The use of a simile shows how even the most innocent
             of creatures can have a dark side, which can be interpreted as a 
             metaphor for the civil war. This is because differing religions 
             played a part in the violence, showing how something that sees itself
             as good and pure can become an excuse for causing terror. <br><br>
This could also be interpreted as a way to undermine the weather, by comparing it
to a familiar image, implying that the storm only creates fear if the people on 
the island allow it to scare them.</p>
             <p id="quote7c">A salvo is several guns firing at once. The repeated
             use of words associated with violence creates a semantic field 
             (“blast”, “pummels” and “salvo” etc.) that suggests the storm is in
             fact a war, drawing a parallel to the Irish civil wars. <br><br>
The fact that this semantic field also continues throughout the poem also shows 
how the voice of the poem feels surrounded by the violence, implying that there 
is no escape. This is unsettling, particularly when coupled with the sibilance of
“space is a salvo”, which synthesises the sound of the wind.</p>
             <p id="quote8c">The use of the oxymoron here can be interpreted in 
             various ways- in a literal sense, the poet is referring to the wind,
             which is not tangible, but still has the power to ‘bombard’ the 
             islanders, and create a sense of fear. This is evident in the final
             phrase “we fear”, which contrasts with the opening statement of 
             confidence “we are prepared”. Consequently, it is implied that it is
             difficult for the islanders to comprehend the scale of the violence
             from the storm. However, it could also be interpreted as referring 
             to the civil war, where the enemy is perhaps not a single race, but
             an idea (i.e. hate and the threat of violence), thus also making it
             invisible, but still just as dangerous. <br><br>
On the other hand, the oxymoron could be seen as highlighting fear as a paradox,
indicating that the fear is unnecessary, as if the people on the island are only
afraid of the storm because they are making themselves afraid, rather than being
in any real danger.</p>
