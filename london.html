             <p id="quote1c">This choice of verb connotes a sense of aimlessness,
             suggesting that the persona in the poem (Blake) and the people 
             around him are repeatedly doing the same mindless activities every
             day, without doing anything to stop their oppression.</p>
             <p id="quote2c">‘Chartered’ shows how humans are trying to use
             their power over nature, which is ironic (and therefore satirical
             of human power) as a river can’t really be controlled. However,
             Blake is suggesting that those in power are not just trying to 
             oppress those they view as ‘inferior’, but nature itself, by 
             turning it into a business. <br><br>
             Between 1760 and 1820, 6 million acres of public land were chartered
             (made private), which created profit for bankers etc. but put the 
             poor at a disadvantage.</p>
             <p id="quote3c">In this case, ‘marks’ has more than one meaning. 
             Initially, it means to notice, but then it shifts to create imagery
             of damage/suffering (‘marks of woe’). This also introduces the idea
             that all the people living in the microcosm of London are marred in
             some way because they are being controlled by those in power. <br><br>
The different meanings also create a sense of insecurity and reflects Blake’s 
unhappiness with the way London is changing, where the working class etc. are 
ignored by the monarchy and the Church etc.</p>
             <p id="quote4c">This is an example of anaphora, where the repetition
             creates a sense of monotony to represent the way the people of 
             London are living their lives. It also enforces the idea of 
             everything being corrupted, and so contributes to Blake’s argument
             for a revolution.</p>
             <p id="quote5c">The use of alliteration emphasises the idea that 
             all the limitations on people are caused by others holding power
             over them. The imagery of ‘manacles’ would be shocking to an 18th
             century audience, as they were used for criminals, implying that 
             people were being treated like criminals purely because of their
             social status.</p>
             <p id="quote6c">This use of imagery criticises the industrial 
             revolution, which meant that children as young as 6 were forced to
             do jobs such as chimney sweeping. The Church was in fact responsible
             for many of these children, and so the black has a double meaning,
             as it represents soot, and also evil. Blake is suggesting that the
             Church, which sees itself as good and holy, is in fact evil because
             it is ignoring the needs of the poor.</p>
             <p id="quote7c">Blake is criticising the monarchy for the 
             oppression, and so he references the French Revolution with a 
             hyperbole created at the time used when addressing the sheer volume
             of French public executions. He is calling for a similar revolution
             in Britain.</p>
             <p id="quote8c">‘Blasts’ is plosive, indicating violence, which 
             creates juxtaposition between the innocent infant and the violent
             world they are born into. However, it is also suggesting that life
             is corrupted from birth.</p>
             <p id="quote9c">This oxymoron also serves to suggest that all good
             things will become corrupted, and could also be a reference to the
             Church, by implying the Church gives the illusion it is pure and 
             omnibenevolent, but that really it is just as responsible for 
             unhappiness and death as any other person in power.</p>
