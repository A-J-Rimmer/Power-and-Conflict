          <div id="commentary">
             <p id="quote1c">In the poem, the main subject (i.e. the statue) is ‘second hand’;
             it’s not the poet or the persona of the poem speaking about what they’ve seen,
             it’s an unnamed ‘traveller’. This implies insignificance, because the poet himself
             didn’t feel like it was necessary to go and see the statue for himself. As the
             statue was supposedly a grand statement of Ozymandias’ power, this undermines the statue,
             showing the insignificance of human power against the power of nature.</p>
             
             <p id="quote2c">This is an example of sibilance, which emulates the sound of the desert 
             sand moving. The effect continues throughout the poem (“passions” and “lifeless”, 
             for example, have an emphasis on the ‘ess’ sound), making the sound of the desert ever 
             present. This suggests that although the statue has decayed, the desert outlasts it, 
             which supports the theme of the power of nature.</p>
            
             <p id="quote4c">This provides the image of decay, adding to the idea that everything will
             eventually crumble, regardless of its strength.</p>
             
             <p id="quote5c">This is an example of plosive alliteration, which creates a harsh sound,
             suggesting Ozymandias was cruel. As a result, the reader feels no sympathy for Ozymandias, 
             which can also be linked to Ozymandias being a metaphor for the current king when Shelley
             wrote the poem (King George III).</p>
             
             <p id="quote6c">This has an ambiguous meaning; it can be interpreted as “make a replica
             or imitation of something” or to “Tease or laugh at in a scornful or contemptuous manner”
             (Oxford Dictionaries). This suggests the sculptor has not just made the statue, but they’ve
             created it in a way that suggests Ozymandias was not the beloved ruler he thought he was 
             (as suggested by “wrinkled lip” and “sneer” which are both negative suggestions about his 
             character). Consequently, the pride of Ozymandias is undermined, making him seem arrogant.</p>
             
             <p id="quote7c">This line creates juxtaposition, as it starts with the image of power/wealth
             etc. but ends with the image of ‘nothing’. This contrast between what Ozymandias thought would
             happen (i.e. that visitors would ‘despair’ because he had so much power) and what actually 
             happened (his empire has disappeared) is an example of situational irony; the statue is meant
             to be a statement of his greatness, but now it just makes him look weak and insignificant 
             compared to nature and time.</p>
             
             <p id="quote8c">This could be described as an oxymoron, as ‘colossal’ implies greatness;
             it would have taken a huge amount of time and materials to create a ‘colossal’ statue, 
             yet ‘wreck’ implies decay. The effect of this is to add to the idea that the power of nature
             has won over the power of humans.</p>
             
             <p id="quote9c">Here, alliteration emphasises the fact that the sand is all that surrounds 
             the statue, with ‘level’ having the connotation of consistency, showing the sand has and will
             outlast the statue.</p>
             
             <p id="quote10c">This gives the idea of the sand being infinite, but this is impossible, 
             it suggests the sand is a metaphor for time. Ozymandias’ statue has not just been eroded 
             by the sand, but by the passage of time itself.</p>
