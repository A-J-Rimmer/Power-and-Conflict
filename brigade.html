When can their glory fade?<br>

Honour the charge they made!<br> 
Honour the Light Brigade,<br> 
Noble six hundred! <br>

          <div id="commentary">
             <p id="quote1c">Victorian audiences would pick up on this biblical
             reference, allowing Tennyson to equate the battle to stories such 
             as that of David and Goliath. However, the ‘valley of death’ refers
             to Psalm 23, where the writer is describing God as a good shepherd.
             This could be interpreted as a criticism of those leading the armies
             during the Crimean war, who were often inexperienced in war and made
             poor decisions. They would have viewed themselves as superior and 
             powerful (i.e. like gods in comparison to the soldiers working for 
             them), but the other references to religion (“mouth of Hell”) are 
             negative, suggests that those in power are not the ‘good shepherds’
             they think they are.</p>
             <p id="quote2c">Most of the poem is in dactylic diameter, but this
             line is not. This draws attention to the word ‘blunder’d’. ‘Blunder’
             means ‘a stupid or careless mistake’ (Collins English Dictionary),
             thus highlighting the ineptitude of those in power in the army.</p>
             <p id="quote3c">The repetition here shows how Tennyson is criticising 
             the Victorian attitudes to order- the soldiers are doing what they 
             have been instructed to do by their social superiors, and this is 
             leading to their deaths. Consequently, it is suggested that the 
             soldiers should have more freedom to challenge what they feel is wrong.</p>
             <p id="quote4c">This word is onomatopoeic, which helps to create a 
             sense of empathy with the soldiers, as it mimics the sound of the guns.
             This increases the tension as the listener feels as if they are 
             experiencing the battle first-hand, where their lives would be in danger.
             <br><br>There are several words repeated in the poem ending with ‘-ered’,
             which has a sound similar to ‘err’, which suggests an error or indecision. </p>
             <p id="quote5c">This has two interpretations- it can be referencing
             the ‘glory’ of the Light Brigade, i.e. the world is wondering when 
             (if at all) it will forget their bravery, portraying the Light Brigade
             as noble and fearless. On the other hand, the world could be wondering
             why the decision was made, acting as a criticism of the military. <br><br>
             Similarly, the word ‘wondered’ features the ‘err’ sound (see 
             “thunder’d”), suggesting a fault, yet the first part of the word ‘won’
             connotes triumph and glory. Consequently, the word is connected with
             both positive and negative imagery.</p>
             <p id="quote6c">This sibilance mimics the sound of the swords, 
             creating a soundscape for the listener, helping them to empathise
             with the soldiers.</p>
             <p id="quote7c">This stanza is very similar to stanza 3, but with 
             some changes, all of which are negative, such as this line (see image below). This 
             suggests that the stanza has been revised, as if the initial idea
             (i.e. the order for the soldiers to go into battle) has been realised
             to be a mistake.<br><br>
