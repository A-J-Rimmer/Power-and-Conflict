<tr><td id="filler1"></td><td id="content"><p><span id="quote1">Our brains ache</span>, in the merciless iced east winds that knive us ...<br> 
Wearied we keep awake because the night is silent ...<br> 
Low, drooping flares confuse our <span id="quote2">memory of the salient</span> ...<br> 
Worried by silence, sentries whisper, curious, nervous,<br> 
But nothing happens.<br> 
<br>
Watching, we hear the mad gusts tugging on the wire,<br> 
Like twitching agonies of men among its brambles.<br> 
Northward, incessantly, the flickering gunnery rumbles,<br> 
Far off, like <span id="quote3">a dull rumour of some other war</span>.<br> 
What are we doing here?<br> 
<br> 
The poignant misery of dawn begins to grow ...<br> 
We only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag stormy.<br> 
Dawn massing in the east her melancholy army<br> 
<span id="quote4">Attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks</span> of grey,<br> 
But nothing happens.<br> 
<br>
<span id="quote5">Sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence</span>.<br> 
Less deadly than the air that shudders black with snow,<br> 
With sidelong flowing flakes that flock, pause, and renew,<br> 
We watch them wandering up and down the wind's<br> 
nonchalance,<br> 
But nothing happens.<br> 
<br> 
Pale flakes with fingering stealth come feeling for our faces -<br> 
We cringe in holes, back on forgotten dreams, and stare,<br> 
snow-dazed,<br> 
Deep into grassier ditches. So we drowse, sun-dozed,<br> 
<span id="quote6">Littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses</span>.<br> 
<span id="quote7">– Is it that we are dying?</span><br> 
<br> 
Slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires, glozed<br> 
With crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;<br> 
For hours the innocent mice rejoice: the house is theirs;<br> 
<span id="quote8">Shutters and doors, all closed</span>: on us the doors are closed, -<br> 
We turn back to our dying.<br> 
<br>
Since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn;<br> 
Now ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit.<br> 
For God's invincible spring our love is made afraid;<br> 
Therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were born,<br> 
<span id="quote9">For love of God seems dying.</span><br> 
<br>
Tonight, His frost will fasten on this mud and us,<br> 
Shrivelling many hands. puckering foreheads crisp.<br> 
The burying-party, picks and shovels in their shaking grasp,<br> 
Pause over half-known faces. All their eyes are ice,<br> 
<span id="quote10">But nothing happens</span>.

          <div id="commentary">
             <p id="quote1c">Firstly, the use of the pronoun ‘our’ emphasises 
             that the war is a collective experience, and that all the soldiers 
             are suffering. This would affect readers during the war, as most 
             would know people who had been sent to the front line. Owen indicates
             to the reader that every soldier feels the same way as him, including
             those potentially known by the reader.<br><br>
             In addition, ‘Our brains ache’ is a reference to the poet John Keats,
             who wrote the poem ‘Ode to a Nightingale’ which opens with the phrase
             “My heart aches”. However, Owen’s use of the phrase has a different
             tone- Keats’ heart aches with happiness, whilst Owen’s brain aches 
             with pain. Here, Owen is implying that poetry should not always be
             ‘nice’, and so undermines ‘propaganda’ poems such as Jessie Pope’s
             ‘Who’s for the Game?’.</p>
             <p id="quote2c">The salient is a “battlefield feature that projects
             into enemy territory” (Wikipedia). This makes it more dangerous than
             the other parts of the trench, thus suggesting that the focus of the
             soldiers has shifted from the immediate danger presented by the human
             enemy to the relentless exhaustion and discomfort caused by nature.
             Owen is suggesting that the soldiers’ main adversary is no longer the
             men on the opposite trench, but the conditions they are living in.</p>
             <p id="quote3c">This is a reference to the Bible, where Jesus says 
             “You will hear of wars and rumours of wars”. He is referring to the
             apocalypse, and so Owen is implying that the soldiers feel like they
             have reached the end of the world. Wilfred Owen was against the idea
             of war, and so it is possible he is providing foreshadowing to his 
             idea of how humanity will end- not due to some external factor, but
             by destroying itself through war.</p>
             <p id="quote4c">This personifies nature, using a metaphor to compare
             the clouds to an army. As a result, it is implied that the soldiers
             face another enemy- the natural world. This provides another view to
             the typical propaganda at the time, known as atrocity propaganda, 
             where crimes committed by the opposing armies were exaggerated or 
             fabricated to provoke a response in the public (with stories circulating
             about the mutilation of Belgian babies by the German army etc.). 
             These stories made the opposition seem to be an inhumane adversary,
             inciting British men to join the army. On the other hand, Owen is 
             suggesting that the other armies aren’t the only enemies. </p>
             <p id="quote5c">This sibilance imitates the sound of bullets, and is
             present throughout the poem, creating a constant reminder of the 
             threat. However, it also creates an impression of the wind, once 
             again suggesting that the soldiers are pitted against nature itself.</p>
             <p id="quote6c">This is the one point in the poem where nature is 
             shown in a positive light- however, this is only in a dream-like 
             sequence (“we drowse”). This creates juxtaposition between the cosy
             nature described in this stanza and the harsh conditions the soldiers
             are really in, emphasising that situations are not always as common
             opinion suggests. This idea can then be applied to public opinions 
             of war and the reality of the trenches. In fact, this may be why the
             soldiers feel distanced from the public- the British people ‘at home’
             have only been exposed to the positive war propaganda, and so the 
             soldiers feel there is not enough empathy.</p>
             <p id="quote7c">This rhetorical question seems to be an answer to the
             previous “what are we doing here?”. This creates a sense of futility
             and hopelessness, causing the reader to empathise with the soldiers.</p>
             <p id="quote8c">This gives an insight into the soldiers’ feelings, 
             and can be interpreted in a number of ways: firstly, it suggests that
             the soldiers feel like the public have lost faith in the war, yet the
             soldiers feel they can’t go home, because they’re still needed. The
             darker interpretation is that the soldiers don’t believe they’ll 
             survive long enough to get home and so the doors are as good as closed.
             This shows how they feel trapped and hopeless- if they stay, they’ll
             die from the conditions, but they can’t go home because they will not
             be permitted to.</p>
             <p id="quote9c">This can be interpreted in two ways- it may be that
             they feel abandoned by their God, that they are no longer protected.
             Alternatively, it may be their faith in God that is dying- earlier 
             in the poem, Owen writes “We only know war lasts”. This suggests that
             the soldiers feel that the only thing they believe in now is the idea
             of home and its distance from the horror of war. The poem repeatedly
             implies that the soldiers are sacrificing themselves (“Therefore, not
             loath, we lie out here”)- in order to protect the world they have left
             behind, like the Bible says Jesus sacrificed himself for humanity.</p>
             <p id="quote10c">This anaphora gives the poem a cyclical structure,
             emphasising how repetitive and pointless the war seems. It could also
             be linked to the Christian idea of purgatory- (Owen originally pursued
             a career in the Church) where the dead waited before going to heaven
             or hell. This implies that the soldiers feel they are already dead,
             even though their bodies are alive.</p>
